Example : 
python26 stats.py --ini=cluster.ini --frequency=10 --name=some_name --output=output_filename --duration=100
Or ( python26 -I cluster.ini  -f 10 -n some_name -o output_filename â€“d 100 )
Frequency : how often collect stats from each node , duration , how long keep the script running.

Once script completes it will create a *.json.gz file that contains all the stats.

1- The requirement is that they must have "yum install sysstats" on all boxes. They also should check which /dev/sd??? Their database is actually installed and change line #283.

2- They need to have python 2.6 installed only on the box where they want to run this script from
yum install git python26 python26-setuptools gcc make g++ python26-devel
easy_install-2.6 paramiko
git clone git://github.com/farshidce/pystatcollector.git
cd pystatcollector
python26 stats.py -h

3- cluster.ini file describes the cluster ssh/REST information.
Ini file example : 
sample.ini
